**Abstract**: Sustainability in tourism is a topic of global relevance, finding multiple mentions in the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. The complex task of balancing tourismâ€™s economic, environmental and social effects requires detailed and up-to-date data. Expanding upon a pilot project for the Albanian market by Braesemann, this paper investigates whether online platform data from [TripAdvisor](https://www.tripadvisor.com) can be employed as an alternative data source in sustainable tourism statistics. Using a web-scraped dataset of the European market, a sustainability label for accommodations can be predicted reasonably well with supervised learning techniques.
